# Analytics Dashboard using TypeScript and Material UI

This project is an analytics dashboard built using React with TypeScript and the Material UI library. The dashboard provides visualizations of various charts and graphs for analyzing data obtained from API calls. For demonstration purposes, we used mock JSON data from the [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs).

## Features

- **React with TypeScript**: Utilized TypeScript for type safety and enhanced development experience in React.
- **Material UI**: Employed Material UI for building a beautiful and responsive user interface.
- **Data Visualization**: Implemented various charts and graphs using Material UI's components for effective data visualization.
- **API Integration**: Integrated with the FakeStoreAPI to fetch mock data for showcasing the analytics dashboard.
